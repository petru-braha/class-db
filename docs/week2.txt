- mysql dbms
  - ++ users
  - ++ schemas
  - the play is with permissions

- oracle dbms
  - ++ users
  - each user has one schma
  - a schma is OWNED by only one user

  - instance = background processes
  - one instance has only one database
  - one instance has multiple accounts
  - one account has only one database schema

  - you can access and use objects in other schemas (with proper permissions), but ownership is per schema, and each schema belongs to one user.
  - thereâ€™s no concept of a schema owning multiple users.
  - you can think of a schema as a namespace or container for objects owned by a single user.

- sys and system are users
- sysdba and sysopr are roles
- sysdba = EVERYTHING
- sysopr = start or shutdown of the database

- tables: dba_users, dba_tables, user_source, user_objects, user_procedures;
